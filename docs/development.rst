Development resources
============================================

The ``gold-miner`` package is divided into two parts, both of which are
housed at the `gold-miner repository`_ and `gold-miner-ui repository`_
on `github`.  The tools are intentionally split into two parts,
leaving just the base ``gold-miner`` package to depend on less module
requirements.  It's designed to be run on smaller devices without the
need of windowing, mathematical and graphical python packages.

.. _gold-miner-ui repository: https://github.com/hardaker/gold-miner-ui

Status: development of the ``gold-miner`` suite is functionally
finished, although feature and bug-fix patches are always welcome.
